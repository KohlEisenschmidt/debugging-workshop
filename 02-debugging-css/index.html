  <h2>Consider the third button...</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Under "elements" view in dev tools, what classes are being applied to this button?</li>
    <li>This button is the wrong color. What color is being overridden? Use the "styles" and "computed" tabs to find out.</li>
    <li>Go to the CSS file that is overriding your desired style and remove the "important" statement.</li>
    <li>Now look at what the button looks like in a hover state. How about a focused state? Active?</li>
  </ol>
